      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;font-size:19px&#34;&gt;
I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at the Binghamton University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/index.php&#34;&gt;College of William and Mary&lt;/a&gt;, and B.S. in Computer Science from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beihang_University&#34;&gt;Beihang University&lt;/a&gt;. I spent several years in industry as a system software engineer before joining academia.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;font-size:19px&#34;&gt;
My research interests are generally in the areas of mobile computing systems, operating systems, embedded systems and wireless networks. Within these areas, I am especially interested in building system supports for emerging computing paradigms, such as edge/cloud computing, mobile/IoT applications, and distributed machine learning. Please check my recent papers below for more details.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;font-size:19px&#34;&gt;
&lt;font color=&#34;SeaBlue&#34;&gt;I am looking for motivated students to work with me in the above research areas/directions. If you are interested and are good at programming, please send me an email, or stop by and let&#39;s chat.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
